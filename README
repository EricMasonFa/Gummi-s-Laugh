If you've ever heard [Gummi's laugh](https://youtu.be/a4B8UAb_i6g?t=289) in one of [elwono's](https://twitter.com/elwono_) videos, you'd wish to have it as a chatwheel voice for the TI10. But I couldn't wait for Valve, so here it is a chatwheel simulator for Gummi's laugh.

## How to use
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/EricMasonFa/Gummi-s-Laugh/releases) for your platform
2. Run the app
3. Use `Shift+l` or `âŒ˜+l` to play the voice
